==========
We're going to practice downloading files from a web site.  We'll use this practice to download more lab materials!
==========
==========
8. Now let's try downloading a file from a web site.  Type in the URL *exactly* as is: google.com.

$ curl google.com

Copy and paste the output below.
----------
<HTML><HEAD><meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html;charset=utf-8">

13. So... the lab materials are located at this url:

http://entertainmenttechnology.github.io/Tsadok-MTEC1003-fall-2018/labs/02/mtec1002-lab-02.zip

Download the file using curl... to a file called mtec1002-lab-02.zip using the commandline.  

REMEMBER to use the -o flag, and follow it with a .zip extension! 

Use ls to verify that it downloaded.

Write down the command that you used to download the file below.  Additionally, write the output of the command below.
----------
curl -o filename.txt
y.github.io/Tsadok-MTEC1003-fall-2018/labs/02/mtec1002-lab-02.zip

Copy and paste the output below.
----------

==========
We're going to mess around with archiving and compressing files.  We'll make a directory with a file in it... archive and compress it.... and uncompress it elsewhere.

==========
16. Go back up to your home directory.  Create a directory called stuff.  List the contents of your home directory to prove that the directory was created.

Copy and paste the output below.

echo ""


==========
17. Change into the "stuff" directory that you just created.  Run the following command (we haven't learned this exact command yet, but we will in the next lab!) exactly as described below:

$ echo "hi" > hello.txt

List the files in the directory you're currently in (which should be stuff).  

Copy and paste the output below.

22. Move stuff.tar.gz into the lab directory that we downloaded.  We didn't learn this command yet, so just type in exactly as is:

$ mv stuff.tar.gz mtec1002-lab-02 

MAKE SURE YOU MOVE THE FILE THAT ENDS IN .gz!

Change your directory to mtec1002-lab-02.  

List the files.  Copy and paste the output below (stuff.tar.gz should be there).
